# 🚀 MediGroq Assistant

> AI-powered medical assistant leveraging Groq's high-performance inference capabilities for lightning-fast healthcare insights.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI magic with Groq**

---

## 🎯 Objective

MediGroq Assistant addresses the challenge of accessible preliminary medical information by providing users with a platform to interact with medical AI through natural language conversations. It serves individuals seeking immediate insights about health concerns through text-based interactions powered by Groq's ultra-fast language models.

The project solves the real-world problem of delayed access to basic medical information, especially in areas with limited healthcare access. By leveraging Groq's ultra-fast inference capabilities, users can get evidence-based preliminary guidance while being appropriately directed toward professional healthcare when needed.

## 🧪 How to Run the Project

### Requirements:
- Python 3.12.10
- Groq API Key
- Flask

### Local Setup:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-team/medigroq-assistant
cd medigroq-assistant

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create .env file with your Groq API key
echo "GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
echo "FLASK_ENV=development" >> .env
echo "SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here" >> .env

# Run the application
python app.py
```

Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

### Troubleshooting:
- If encountering Groq client errors, ensure you have the latest version installed: `pip install --upgrade groq`
- If you see CORS issues when testing locally, you might need to configure your Flask app to handle CORS properly
- For optimal performance, ensure you're using the most efficient Groq model available for your use case
